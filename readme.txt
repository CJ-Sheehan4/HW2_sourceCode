Approach:
Based off the hint in the assignments hint of how the background are tricky,
I had the whole main div have the light blue background and then for then 
#content and footer I made their background be white. From there I adjusted
the margins of the #content and footer to align. I then adjusted the padding as
well to appear most like the example pictures. This approach was also used
for the header of the main div. I have the main divs width be 80% with a 
min-width of 600px so that it adjusts when the page is zoomed in/out or if 
the size is changed.
